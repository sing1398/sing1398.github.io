Hello, I'm Sahiljeet Singh :bowtie: , An Interactive Media Designer based in Ottawa. 


# Developement Phase

> During the developement of this website, There were minor errors.
> Took Inspiration from Behance.
> 
> I also wanted to implement Locomotive smooth scroll ,
https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-scroll

> So that I could add parallax and speed to different elements and make it more interactive.
> But due to no knowledge of Javascript, I couldn't but I have experimented with
> It on my Official Portfolio www.singhvisuals.com
> It would be great if you can suggest a Javascript tutorial which is specially for Web Designers.
