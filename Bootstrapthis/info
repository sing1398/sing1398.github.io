                <h2 class="heading2">Our Statement of Faith</h2>
                <p>
                    We believe the scriptures, both the old and new testaments, are verbally inspired of god and are the revelation of god to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct. (2 timothy 3:15-17, 1 Thessalonians 2:13, 2 peter 1:21)<br><br>
                    We believe in one true god - There is one god, eternally existent in three persons: father, son and Holy Spirit. These three are coequal and co-eternal (1 John 5:7; genesis 1:26; Matthew 3:16-17, 28:19; Luke 1:35; Isaiah 9:6; Hebrews 3:7-11). 
                    <br><br>
                    We believe in the deity of Jesus – We believe that  Jesus Christ is god the son, the second person of the trinity. He is the only man ever to have lived a sinless life. He was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, performed miracles, died on the cross for mankind and thus, atoned for our sins through the shedding of his blood. He rose from the dead on the third day according to the scriptures, ascended to the right hand of the father, and will return again in power and glory. (John 1:1,14, 20:28; i timothy 3:16; Isaiah 9:6; Philippians 2:5-6; i timothy 2:5).
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    We believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit - When a person begins a relationship with Jesus Christ, the holy Spirit begins to live inside the believer at the moment of salvation. We also believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit as a biblical experience that follows salvation Galatians 3:14-15) 
                    <br><br>
                    We believe in redemption by the power of the Holy Spirit through the Word of God is essential for personal salvation (Ephesians 5:25-27).
                    <br><br>
                    We believe that the redemptive work of Christ on the cross provides divine healing for the soul of everyone that believes. ( Acts 3: 16, Acts 9: 32 -35).
                    <br><br>
                    We believe that when an individual receives the Holy Ghost, he receives divine enablement for divine service and witness. (Acts 1: 8; 2:4). 
                    <br><br>
                    We believe in the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost. (Romans 15: 16).

                <h2 class="heading2">Our Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    Our vision is to win souls through the preaching, teaching and witnessing to them the word of god and baptizing them in the name of Jesus Christ. To make true disciples of our members by educating and training our members so that they may go and spread his word wherever they go. The church strives to win souls. “where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.” proverbs 29:18
